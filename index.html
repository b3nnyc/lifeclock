					<h3>Who is Life Clock?</h3>
					<p>Life Clock is a person - Dr. Julie A. Morton, FEA. Q.Med, a 3rd generation family business
						professional providing strategic consultation and coaching from directors to c-suite business
						leaders, individuals and owners in public and private organizations and affluent families within
						the
						Family Enterprise System. I have a Ph.D. in Organizational /Interpersonal communication and have
						taught, consulted, and acted as a governance advisor to multigenerational families and family
						companies. Results have shown that I have utilized highly effective, proven tools, techniques,
						and
						leadership, helping high-functioning successful people and affluent families challenge their

					<h3>Who Life Clock serves</h3>
					<p>Life Clock works with the young, those getting older, the people transitioning their roles, the retired, the
						retiring, families, individuals, with people who are grieving, and with the ill. Work is done in
						service of:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>facilitating important conversation</li>
						<li>improving relationships</li>
						<li>effectively navigating family tensions</li>
						<li>creating opportunities to alleviate regrets and guilt</li>
						<li>aiding with personal indiscretion management in a confidential way that maintains dignity
							and integrity</li>
						<li>ensuring you keep your rights, agency, and ability to make good decisions.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Taking time to set your house in order becomes not just something that you'd like to do one day,
						but holds greater urgency as you get older, wish to retire, and/or become ill. It is a gift you
						give yourself, your family, your company, your friends, and your community.</p>

					<div class="testimonials-container">
						<div class="testimonials-one testimonial">
							<p class="testimonials-body">I was initially skeptical given some preconceived notions
								however, you encouraged me to jump in both feet first…you have a unique talent to
								ask questions that make one assess their whole perspective on their views, values
								and authenticity. The questions are so pointed, and so perfect, it would leave me
								'digging deep' not only at the moment but days later. Julie, you are nothing less
								than amazing and I appreciate the time and exhausting sessions we have shared
								together.</p>
							<p class="testimonials-name">Nicole Neff, President-Owner, Bay Builders</p>
						</div>
						<div class="testimonials-two testimonial">
							<p class="testimonials-body">When I first described my view of retirement to Julie as
								what seemed like setting sail into a void of nothingness and loneliness. Of endless
								days of purposelessness filling in time until the inevitable, she very quickly
								turned my attention towards the ocean teaming with possibilities flowing beneath my
								windsurfer... And so we began… Julie is approachable and non-threatening, she
								listens well and hears what you do not know you are saying, that all important
								underlying message. This coupled with her qualifications, knowledge and experience
								makes her most suited to helping me achieve my goals.</p>
							<p class="testimonials-name">Sandy Potter, Skin Health Canada: Past President, Owner</p>
						</div>
						<div class="testimonials-three testimonial">
							<p class="testimonials-body">I first met Julie 12 years ago together with my family. She
								made such an impression on me that day that I remember the encounter clearly: how
								she seemed to understand our family dynamic and each of us as individuals, how she
								maintained control of the flow of conversation no matter how emotionally charged the
								topics became, and how I left that day feeling empowered and hopeful. I've felt this
								same way working with Julie ever since.<br><br>Without hesitation, I can say that
								Julie has helped me grow as a person and live a fuller life, true to my values. For
								my family, Julie has helped us navigate some of our most urgent and challenging
								times with grace and humility. She also gave us tools to draw from on our own to
								apply during moments of tension and uncertainty. Without Julie, we wouldn't have had
								the skills, trust or willingness to engage in the difficult but essential work of
								coming together as a family.</p>
